This file contains code for a simple parsing algorithm that was created using Python 3.12.0

It has several test cases which can be outputed in the shell so the user can visualize the outputs of the algorithm

- Passes regular expression string into parse tree
- Structures it into simple section which are then represented into simple outputs
- Several parsing functions are included for simplicity
- Using basic logic operators
